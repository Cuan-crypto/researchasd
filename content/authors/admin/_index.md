Hi. 
My name is Ciara Keenan and I am a post-doctoral researcher with strong quantitative background and an established international reputation in evidence synthesis methodology. I am proficient with the R statistical environment and use this for all meta-analysis including meta-regression, network meta-analysis, obtaining cluster-robust variances etc. 

I am most committed to capacity building in evidence synthesis which has led to my work as Founder and Editor of the [meta-evidence blog]( http://meta-evidence.co.uk/) and twitter’s [@evidencerobot]( https://twitter.com/EvidenceRobot) and [@COVID_Evidence](https://twitter.com/COVID_Evidence). I provide regular training and workshops across various evidence synthesis topics and am currently leading several review teams. In conjunction with these roles, I am a Methods Editor and Information Retrieval specialist for Campbell’s Education Coordinating Group (ECG).

**Fields of concentration:** systematic reviews | meta-analyses | education | race | ethnicity | diversity | homelessness | disability | vulnerable and marginalised groups | post-conflict societies
